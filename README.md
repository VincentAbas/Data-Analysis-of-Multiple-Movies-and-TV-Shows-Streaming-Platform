# Data Preperation
  - The data preparation is done in python in google colab, you can see it here: 
## Data Merging
  - Since all of the dataset have the same columns/parameters I just stacked it together.

## Data Cleaning
  - Removed Null Values.
  - Removed Duplicates.
  - Removed Unnecessary data/columns(too many missing data to be useful).
    
## One-Hot Encoding
  - I used One-Hot Encoding on the genres as there are movies/tv shows that listed multiple genres in one column.
